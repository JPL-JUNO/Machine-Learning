\section{silhouette coefficient}
To calculate the silhouette coefficient of a single example in our dataset, we can
apply the following three steps:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Calculate the cluster cohesion, $a^{(i)}$, as the average distance between an example, $\bm{x}^{(i)}$, and all other points in the same cluster.
    \item Calculate the cluster separation, $b^(i)$, from the next closest cluster as the average distance between the example, $\bm{x}^{(i)}$, and all examples in the nearest cluster.
    \item Calculate the silhouette, $s^{(i)}$, as the difference between cluster cohesion and separation divided by the greater of the two, as shown here:
          \begin{equation}
              s^{(i)}=\frac{b^{(i)}-a^{(i)}}{\max\{b^{(i)},a^{(i)}\}}
          \end{equation}
\end{enumerate}
