\subsection{}
Knowing how other variables affect the target variable, churn, is the key to understanding the data and building a good model. This process is called feature importance analysis, and it’s often done as a part of exploratory data analysis to figure out which variables will be useful for the model. It also gives us additional insights about the dataset and helps answer questions like “What makes customers churn?” and “What are the characteristics of people who churn?”

We have two different kinds of features: categorical and numerical. Each kind has different ways of measuring feature importance, so we will look at each separately.
