ROC curves and AUC scores tell us how well the model separates positive and negative examples. What is more, AUC has a nice probabilistic interpretation: it tells us what the probability is that a randomly selected positive example will have a score higher than a randomly selected negative example.

Suppose we randomly pick a customer that we know churned and a customer who didn't and then apply the model to these customers and see what the score is for each. We want the model to score the churning customer higher than the non-churning one. AUC tells us the probability of that happening: it's the probability that the score of a randomly selected churning customer is higher than the score of a randomly selected non-churning one.
