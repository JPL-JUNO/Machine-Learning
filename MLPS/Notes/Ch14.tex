\subsubsection*{Determining the size of the convolution output}
The output size of a convolution is determined by the total number of times that we shift the filter, $\bm{w}$, along the input vector. Let's assume that the input vector is of size $n$ and the filter is of size $m$. Then, the size of the output resulting from $\bm{y}=\bm{x}*\bm{w}$ , with padding $p$ and stride $s$, would be determined as follows:
\begin{equation}
    o=\Bigl\lfloor\frac{n+2p-m}{s}\Bigr\rfloor+1
\end{equation}
