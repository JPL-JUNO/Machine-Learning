\subsection{An object-oriented perceptron API}
If all the weights are initialized to zero, the learning rate parameter, $\eta$, affects only the scale of the weight vector, not the direction. Consider a vector,$v_1 =[1~2~3]$, where the angle between $v_1$ and a vector, $v_2 = 0.5 \times v_1$, would be exactly zero.
