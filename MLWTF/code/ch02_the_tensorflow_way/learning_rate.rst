    * - Learning rate size
      - Advantages/disadvantages
      - Uses
    * - Smaller learning rate
      - Converges slower but more accurate results
      - If the solution is unstable, try lowering the learning rate first
    * - Larger learning rate
      - Less accurate, but converges faster
      - For some problems, helps prevent solutions from stagnating
